#### Boot sequence

- u-Boot SPL
- u-Boot
- Linux kernel
- `/linuxrc` (busybox init)
- `/etc/init.d/rcS` starts `/etc/init.d/S*` (`dropbear`, ...)
- `/bin/seed.sh`
- `/usr/apps/etc/init.d/S*` (wifi, ...)
- `/usr/apps/etc/init.d/CS*` as `creality` user (Klipper, GUI, ...) 
- getty on UART

```

- First 1MB of MMC contains GPT table, u-Boot SPL (encrypted), u-Boot (encrypted)
- `ota` - likely unused. V1.0.0.23 `/bin/seed.sh` used it to store rootfs signature (`part_deplibs_signature_devblk` variable is still presesnt in V1.0.0.26, but not used)
- `sn_mac` - encrypted model, board and uniq unit info
- `rtos` - not encrypted firmware (likely video related)
- `rtos2` - likely used by klipper (reference found in `/usr/data/printer_data/logs/klippy.log`)
- `kernel` - encrypted kernel with initial RAMfs
- `kernel2` - encrypted older kernel with RAMfs
- `rootfs` - "signed" squashfs at 2048 byte offset, verified and loop-mounted on `/usr/deplibs`, by `/bin/seed.sh` on boot 
- `rootfs2` - not encrypted ext4, mounted on `/usr/apps` on boot
- `rootfs_data` - likely unused (currently `0x00` fileld)
- `userdata` - not ncrypted ext4, mounted on /usr/data (g-code files, logs ...)

`/dev/mmcblk0boot0` (4MB) and `/dev/mmcblk0boot1` (4MB) likely unused (0x00 filled).

`/dev/mmcblk0rpmb` (16MB) should be write-only [RPMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_Protected_Memory_Block) partition likely related to "secure boot".


#### MMC dump

To make a backup copy (in case recovery method will be available in the future)

`ssh root@k1c 'dd if=/devmmcblk0 bs=1M' > mmc.dump`

MMC of the fresh machine is mostly 0x00 filled, so You can convert it to sparse file (shoult take ~430MB real disk space).

Most analysis can be done on `mmc.dump` to minimize the risk of bricking k1c.

#### Decryption

`/bin/seed.sh` loads `/lib/modules/soc_security.ko` module, which is responsible for `/dev/sc` device used to verify/decrypt binaries.
Client tool is `/bin/cmd_sc`, used by the same `seed.sh`.

Most encrypted binaries have `SCBT` as the first 4 bytes.

u-Boot SPL:
```
dd if=mmc.dump bs=1 skip=17920 seek=512 count=18944 of=spl.encrypted
echo -n SCBT | dd of=spl.encrypted conv=notrunc
cmd_sc src=spl.encrypted dst=spl
```

u-Boot:
```
dd if=mmc.dump of=u-boot.encoded bs=1 skip=41984 count=195184
cmd_sc src=u-boot.encrypted dst=u-boot
```

Linux and RAMfs:

- dump `kernel` or `kernel2` partiton from `mmc.dump` to `kernel.encrypted`
- `cmd_sc src=kernel.encrypted dst=kernel.img

```
binwalk --extract kernel.img
zcat < Linux-5.10.186.bin > Linux-5.10.186.bin.extracted
binwalk --extract Linux-5.10.186.bin.extracted
cpio -it < decompressed.bin
```

Applications:

Eight binaried are decrypted by `/bin/seed.sh` to `/tmp/apps` (You can download from there or decrypt using `cmd_sc`):

- `alchemistp` - golang, likely responsible for most housekeeping, network communications with Creality at `api.crealitycloud.com`, etc.
- `mdns` - multicast DNS, :TODO: - no clear reason to encrypt it 
- `nexusp` - [Moonriker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker) alternative implementation (?), the same API (?), likely required by `vectorp` (listens on 7125/tcp, active tcp connection with `vectorp`), reported as usable from remote Fluidd. Controls enclosure fan.
- `onyxp` - remote control/video related (?)
- `quintusp` - LED on/off (if stopped - light switching from GUI has no effect), maybe something more
- `solusp` - likely "AI" related (print failure detection/handling)
- `thirteenthp` - ?is it doing anything? (startup script `CS59thirteenthp` likely has errors) video stream related
- `vectorp` - main and biggest, responsible for GUI, likely C++ uning LVGL (https://lvgl.io/) for graphics, plaintext mqtt reporting to Creality (`mqtt.crealitycloud.com`, ...)

Klipper is available in python bytecode (`.pyc` files), some configs are plaintext.

#### Network

Current status: `ss -nap`

IPtables rules: `iptables-save` 
  - `-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8081` - forwards 80/tcp to `vectorpp`

Live traffic: `tcpdump -n` (or `tcpdump -n not port 22` to filter-out ssh traffic)`
